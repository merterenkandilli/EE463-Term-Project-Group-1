bridge configration => 1 3 5 => I am changing this because simulink convention for thyristor is different => 1 3 5
                       2 4 6                                                                                 4 6 2

firing angle = x

6+1 => x+30 to x+90 step 1
1+2 => x+90 to x+150 step 2
2+3 => x+150 to x+210 step 3
3+4 => x+210 to x+270 step 4
4+5 => x+270 to x+330 step 5
5+6 => x+330 to x+30 step 6
